# Web-Scraping
This repository will contain my snippets of python code used in mini projects related to web scraping

DataScientistSalarySurvey.ipynb - This ipython notebook has code which scrapes visadoor.com website to extract 'Data Scientist' 
salaries in USA. This website only has information of H1-B petitions filed in 2016. Any salaries that are taken into consideration are those of international candidates.

HappyHourDowntownCincy.ipynb - This ipython notebook has code which scrapes Downtown Cincinnati website to extract happy hour
information for bars on this website.
